# dials_browser_rlv
A DIALS reciprocal lattice viewer in the browser without a DIALS installation. [Available here](https://toastisme.github.io/dials_browser_rlv/).

## Features
- Drag .expt files into the browser to view the reciprocal cell
- Drag .refl files into the browser to view reflection centroids in reciprocal space
- Hover over indexed reflections to see Miller indices
- Hover over sample to see the unit cell
- Hover over beam to see the beam direction, and wavelength (if monochromatic)
- Compare calculated reflections of current model against observed reflections

## Limitations
- Currently displays only the first experiment in the .expt file
